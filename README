Starst0rm is an easy to use frontend for xpwn. The xpwn components have already been released, but the GUI is still a work in progress.

Supported devices:

    * iPhone 2G
    * iPhone 3G
    * iPhone 3GS (old bootrom)
    * iPod Touch 1G
    * iPod Touch 2G (old bootrom)

Please note: All devices must be pre-jailbroken, or one must run sn0wbreeze in Wine to perform the actual exploit.

Building:
	First, pull some dependencies:
		sudo apt-get install libz-dev bsdiff libzip2-dev libpng-dev libusb-dev libplist-dev libssl-dev

	Note: those downloading pre-compiled packages need only libzip, libplist, and libssl, and do not need developement packages.

	Then, issue: ./buildAll
