Starst0rm incorperates the work of MANY others, and all the hard work wasn't done be me. That said, here goes nothing...


GTK+
	Thanks to everyone who has helped make GTK+ into what it is.

Xpwn
	This utility is merely an implementation of Pwnage, which is the work of
	roxfan, Turbo, wizdaz, bgm, and pumpkin. Those guys are the real heroes.

	Also, the new super-awesome bootrom exploit is courtesy of wizdaz.

	MuscleNerd has put a lot of work into the 3G effort. The BootNeuter unlock
	for first-generation iPhones packaged within is primarily his effort.

	Thanks also go to gray and c1de0x for their RCE efforts. saurik is the author
	of Cydia, included within. bugout was the lucky guy who did our first 3G tests.

	Thanks to chris for his hardware wisdom, Zf for his French humor, and pytey
	for the support on the serial stuff.

	idevice's "ready for custom IPSW" art was graciously contributed by KinetiX

	XPwn attempts to use all the same data files and patches as PwnageTool to
	avoid duplication of present and future labor. I believe that wizdaz probably
	put the most sweat into PwnageTool, and the pwnage ramdisk is the work of
	Turbo.

	XPwn on Linux would not have been possible without libibooter, which was
	written by cmw, based on the Linux iPhone recovery driver written by geohot.

	A special shout-out to cmw, who I have been helping with winpwn. He's put a
	lot of hard work into winpwn, and should also be credited with doing some of
	the initial exploratory work with the undocumented DMG format.

Starst0rm
	The entire Starst0rm codebase is the work of boxingsquirrel.

	Thanks to SharpieBandit for agreeing to test this mess ;P.
